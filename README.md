## STORING IAM USERS DETAILS BACKEND IN AN S3 BUCKET(BACKEND)

All the remote states of different resources belonging to different projects can be stored in one s3 bucket as backend. This will:

    - enable the admin share the state with other users on the project.
    - save the remote state safely.
